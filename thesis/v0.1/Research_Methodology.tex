The Methodology section should provide a clear explanation of the research approach.  You want your reader to agree that you carefully considered your method so that we can trust your results to be both insightful (\underline{mean something}) and credible (\underline{not subject to error}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item A clear description of the methodology, how it creates a scientific investigation and operates to collect meaningful data.
    \item A clear justification of \underline{why} you have chosen this particular approach.
    \item Information needed for a reader to understand \underline{how} you did it (can a reader \underline{reproduce} your work, and collect equally valid results? e.g. hardware/software used, configuration, number of trials, any procedures used, etc.)
    \item A description of any approaches taken to process collected data, e.g. metrics are used to combine data in a meaningful way - you should state any used explicitly, their utility, their suitability to your methodology and their limitations.  
\end{itemize}



As on can see in Table \ref{tab:Table_with_numbers} there are numbers involved.

For example, if $x>0$ then we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sum}
\sigma =\int_{x=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2}dx \quad ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the integral (see Equations \ref{eq:sum}).

This section provides detailed information on algorithm and its implementation.

\section{Communication with STDMA}

In STDMA, agents share a single channel by autonomously determining the serial speaking order.
The method for determining the speaking order involves agents autonomously allocating the right to use free times within the channel.


\subsection{Synchronised Clock}

% STDMA假设agent之间拥有同步时钟。
\begin{quotation}
    \textbf{Assumption 1}: 
    STDMA assumes that agents have synchronised clocks. 
\end{quotation}

% 在实际中，同步时钟一般用GPS实现。在本文的模拟中，用一个ROS2publisher和一个topic来实现。
In practice, the synchronised clock is typically implemented with GPS. 
In the implemented simulation of this paper, it's achieved using a ROS2 publisher and a topic.
% 一个专用的ros2节点定时翻转其成员bool值，并在每次翻转此值时将翻转后的bool值publish到时钟topic中，这样在时钟topic中来形成一个占空比为50%的方波时钟信号。
A dedicated ROS2 node periodically toggles its member boolean value and publishes the toggled value to the clock topic each time it's flipped. This creates a square wave clock signal with a 50\% duty cycle in the clock topic.
% 其他普通agent通过订阅时钟话题的方式来获得同步时钟信号。
Other standard agents obtain the synchronised clock signal by subscribing to the clock topic.
